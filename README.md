Fully functional to-do list web app.
This app allows users to create custom lists and store items on the list.
The items can be deleted by checking the box next to the item.
By default, the app routes to the home page and displays "Today" as the title of the list.
If the user wishes to customize the list name, add the desired list name to the URL path following that last "/".
